 		<h1>Branches</h1>

    <p>Branches in Git are incredibly lightweight as well. They are simply pointers to a specific commit - nothing more. 
    </p>
    <p>This is why many Git enthusiasts chant the mantra:

    branch early, and branch often</p>

    <p>Because there is no storage / memory overhead with making many branches, it's easier to logically divide up your work than have big beefy branches.</p>

    <p>When we start mixing branches and commits, we will see how these two features combine. For now though, just remember that a branch essentially says "I want to include the work of this commit and all parent commits.</p>

    <h1>Branches and Merging </h1>
    <p>The first method to combine work that we will examine is git merge . Merging in Git creates a special commit that has two unique parents. A commit with two parents essentially means "I want to include all the work from this parent over here and this one over here, and the set of all their parents. </p>
    <p>

Here we have two branches; each has one commit that's unique. This means that neither branch includes the entire set of "work" in the repository that we have done. Let's fix that with merge. </p>
